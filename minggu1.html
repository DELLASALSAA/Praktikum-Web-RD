                <h2>Innovations in natural ingredients and their use in skin care.</h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Naturalingredients have been used traditionally for millennia and their application in topical creams, lotions and preparations within the traditional medicines and healing traditions of many cultures has been observed.
                Over the last 20 years, clinical and laboratory studies have identified the benefits of an array of natural ingredients for skin care.
                Consequently, a number of these ingredients and compounds are today being developed, used or considered not only for anti-aging effects, but also for use in dermatologic disorders. 
                Certain ingredients, such as colloidal oatmeal and aloe vera, have been identified as beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, respectively, due to their anti-inflammatory properties. 
                For combating acne and rosacea, green tea, niacinamide and feverfew are considered efficacious. 
                As to hyperpigmentation and antioxidative capabilities, licorice, green tea, arbutin, soy, acai berry, turmeric and pomegranate are among those plants and compounds found to be most beneficial. 
                Additional research is needed to determine to confirm and elucidate the benefits of these ingredients in the prevention and management of skin disease.</p>

                <h2>Development of a skincare robot</h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">With aging, human skin develops a dry condition called senile xerosis. The skin lesion can be prevented by daily skin care such as applying an ointment containing moisturizing factors several times a day. Aged persons, however, have difficulties in accessing the back and rely therefore on nursing care for such treatment. Unfortunately, in underpopulated areas such nursing care may not always be available. To tackle this problem, the concept of a skincare robot is proposed. The feasibility of the concept is then confirmed by designing a real skincare robot and by performing experiments for applying ointment on human's back. 
                The robot developed is able to recognize the shape of the body, to plan the appropriate motion paths for the hand, and to execute the task without applying any excessive forces. </p>

                <h2>Children and newborn skin care and prevention</h2>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Neonatal skin suffers a progressive adaptation to the extrauterine environment and special care is needed during this period. This skin is very sensitive, thin and fragile. Immaturity of the epidermal barrier reduces the defense against the excessive proliferation of microbes and makes the skin more vulnerable to trauma and percutaneous drug toxicity. Because of the peculiar characteristics of newborn, infant and children's skin, the use of cosmetic products designed for hygiene and protection requires caution. In order to preserve the integrity of neonatal and child's skin, this article reviewed basic preventive care practices in relation to hygiene, bathing, cleansing agents, topical products and their percutaneous toxicity.</p>
